# Procedural mesh generation with Marching Cubes.

The repo is called MarchingOctTrees because the original plan was to implement my own OctTree data structure and use it to optimize the MC algorithm, but currently im working on a SIMD implementation using compute shaders in HLSL, will come back to the OctTree later :p.
